This project was an excellent challenge for me. Bootstrap is very straightforward in how you use it, but it is also strict. The HTML was pretty much the same, it's just the formatting (CSS) that is different. The biggest challenge for me was not using CSS. I had to use it for some things, but I couldn't rely on it and had to use Bootstrap for it instead. It wasn't hard to use because Bootstrapâ€™s website has everything you could need and more but it was more annoying to not be able to use it. I found that after a while, I started to enjoy using Bootstrap and learning the different classes in it. Something I learned was the different classes in Bootstrap and how they interact with each other. Learning them also helped me be better with actual CSS. 

There were a couple of things I couldn't do from my lack of knowledge; for example, I couldn't do the exact layout for the about page on the laptop design. Im sure if I really looked at it and spent a lot of time on it, I could figure it out, but for now, I had to leave it be. Overall, I enjoyed this assignment and learning Bootstrap.
